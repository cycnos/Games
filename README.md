# Games - Lua - Love2D

Repository containing some video games I developped to learn Lua / Love2D.


## Pong 

Folder `pong` contains a simple remake of famous pong.
This is the first game I developped and therefore it contains very basic stuff.
The game is playable simultaneously by two players on a local device.

### Skills Learned
